\details{
The package is designed for the identification of multi-optimal subnetworks. The problem is formulated as the multi-objective optimization of two or more functions  that are evaluated on subnetworks. The problem is solved using a graph-based version (Mosca and Milanesi 2013) of the Non-dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm II (NSGA-II) (Deb, et al. 2002). Each solution of the problem is a set of identifiers that form a connected subnetwork and genetic operators are designed to modify subnetworks within the constraints of the network they belong to.}
